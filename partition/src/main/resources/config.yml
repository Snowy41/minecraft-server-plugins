# Partition Plugin Configuration
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# This plugin splits your server into multiple isolated "mini-servers"
# Each partition can have its own worlds and plugins, running independently.
#
# Use Cases:
# - Build Server: Safe building environment without affecting production
# - Dev Server: Testing new features and plugins
# - Production Server: Main gameplay server
# - Mini-Games: Isolated game instances

# ===== ISOLATION SETTINGS =====
# Controls how players in different partitions interact
isolation:
  # Should players only see chat from their partition?
  chat: true

  # Should tab list only show players in the same partition?
  tablist: true

  # Should commands be partition-specific? (Experimental)
  commands: false

  # Should world borders be enforced per-partition?
  world-border: true

# ===== PARTITIONS =====
# Define your server partitions here
# Each partition is an isolated mini-server

      - "world_nether"   # Nether for build server
      - "world_the_end"  # End for build server

    # Plugins active in this partition
    # Only these plugins will be active when players are in this partition

  # ===== EXAMPLE: MINI-GAME PARTITION =====
  # You can create partitions for specific mini-games
  # minigame1:
  #   name: "SkyWars Arena"
  #   description: "SkyWars mini-game server"
  #   enabled: false
  #
  #   worlds:
  #     - "skywars_world"
  #
  #   plugins:
  #     - "CorePlugin"
  #     - "SkyWarsPlugin"
  #
  #   spawn-world: "skywars_world"
  #   spawn-location:
  #     x: 0.5
  #     y: 100.0
  #     z: 0.5
  #     yaw: 0.0
  #     pitch: 0.0
  #
  #   auto-load: false
  #   persistent: false  # Don't persist, reset on restart

# ===== NOTES =====
#
# 1. ADDING WORLDS TO PARTITIONS
#    To add your current world to a partition:
#    - Use: /partition add world <partition-id>
#    - Example: /partition add world build
#    - This adds your current world to the partition
#
# 2. PLUGIN ISOLATION
#    - Plugins listed in a partition's "plugins" list will be considered active
#    - Players in that partition will only interact with those plugins
#    - Other plugins will be "invisible" to players in that partition
#
# 3. RESTARTING PARTITIONS
#    - Use: /partition restart <partition-id>
#    - Example: /partition restart dev
#    - This reloads plugins for that partition without affecting others
#    - Players will be temporarily moved out and back in
#
# 4. WORLD MANAGEMENT
#    - Worlds can only belong to ONE partition
#    - Make sure world names match exactly (case-sensitive)
#    - World must be loaded by Bukkit before assignment
#
# 5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
#    - Each partition adds some overhead
#    - Recommended maximum: 5-10 partitions per server
#    - Monitor RAM and CPU usage when running multiple partitions
#
# 6. PLUGIN LOADING
#    - CorePlugin should be in ALL partitions (required)
#    - Partition-specific plugins isolate functionality
#    - Hot-reloading plugins is experimental - use with caution!
#
# 7. SPAWN LOCATIONS
#    - Set accurate spawn locations for each partition
#    - Players teleporting to a partition will spawn here
#    - Use /partition tp <partition-id> to test
